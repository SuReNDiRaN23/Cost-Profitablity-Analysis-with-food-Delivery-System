Cost and Profitability Analysis of a Food Delivery System is a comprehensive evaluation aimed at understanding and optimizing the financial dynamics of a food delivery operation.

The aim is to identify areas where the service can reduce costs, increase revenue and implement pricing or commmission strategies that enhance profitability.

The tasks and method we  can undergo using the dataset are:

1) Importing necessary libraries and Dataset:
[Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn]
[pd.read_csv("food_orders_new_delhi.csv")]

2) Date-Time Conversion and null values handling:
[from datetime import datetime]
[pd.to_datetime(food_orders['Delivery Date and Time'])]
[def extract_discount(discount_str):]

3) Cost and Profitability Analysis:
  Comparing "Profit" values with sum of ("Total Revenue", "Total Cost")

**As the analysis of THIS dataset impies that there is a significant Net loss, we need to strategize a plan with respect to the factors causing Loss**

4) Understanding the Distribution of costs, revenue and profit.
With Matplotlib,
[plt.xlabel('Profit')
plt.ylabel('Number of Orders')
plt.axvline(food_orders['Profit'].mean(), color='red', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=1)
plt.show()]

5) Breaking down costs into Discounts, Delivery Fee, Payment Processing Fee:
With Matplotlotlib again,
[costs_breakdown = food_orders[['Delivery Fee', 'Payment Processing Fee', 'Discount Amount']].sum()
plt.pie(costs_breakdown, labels=costs_breakdown.index, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140, colors=['gold', 'lightblue', 'tomato'])
plt.show()]

6) Considering major contribution on costs(Discounts), promotional strategies might be impacting overall profit:

**Building New Strategy to gain more profit**
As we know, discounts are the major factor of revenue loss, we are focusing to rectify the errors:

7) Calculating:
*1) The Average commission percentage for profitable orders*
*2) The average dicount percentage for profitable orders*

8)  A strategy that aims for a commission rate closer to 24% and a discount rate around 2% could potentially improve profitability across the board.
To configure and visualize:
[food_orders['Simulated Commission Fee'] = food_orders['Order Value'] * (recommended_commission_percentage / 100)
food_orders['Simulated Discount Amount'] = food_orders['Order Value'] * (recommended_discount_percentage / 100)]
[food_orders['Simulated Profit'] = (food_orders['Simulated Commission Fee'] -
                                   food_orders['Simulated Total Costs'])]

Visualize with **Seaborn**,
[sns.kdeplot(food_orders['Profit'], label='Actual Profitability', fill=True, alpha=0.5, linewidth=2)

# simulated profitability
sns.kdeplot(food_orders['Simulated Profit'], label='Estimated Profitability with Recommended Rates', fill=True, alpha=0.5, linewidth=2)

plt.title('Comparison of Profitability in Food Delivery: Actual vs. Recommended Discounts and Commissions')
plt.xlabel('Profit')
plt.ylabel('Density')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()]

**The visualization compares the distribution of profitability per order using actual discounts and commissions versus the simulated scenario with recommended discounts (2%) and commissions (24%).**
